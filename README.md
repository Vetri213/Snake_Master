# Snake Master

Snake Master is a recreation of the original Snake game. Here, you are not the snake but its master. Simply point and your snake will move in that direction. There are no boundaries but make sure you don't make your snake run into itself.

I created this project as a fun way to learn more about hand-pose estimation and utilizing computer vision to control software using gestures.
